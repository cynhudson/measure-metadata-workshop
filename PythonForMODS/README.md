#Using lxml and modsqual to parse and assess MODS XMLÂ¶
In this tutorial, we will learn the basics of parsing XML with the third-party lxml library and assessing MODS XML metadata with modsqual, a module (in progress!) that simplifies lxml for working with MODS.

We'll we working through the Jupyter notebook included in this directory, lxml_and_modsqual_tutorial.ipynb. If you've already downloaded this repository and you have Jupyter notebook or IPython notebook installed (I recommend the [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda) distribution) you can open the notebook by opening up a command line/terminal window, navigating to this folder, and entering the command:
```
ipython notebook
```
or
```
jupyter notebook
```
This should launch a new browser window with the folder structure of your current working directory. Click on the tutorial file to open the tutorial in a new tab.

To close out of Jupyter or IPython notebook, enter `Ctrl-C` in the terminal and close your tabs.
